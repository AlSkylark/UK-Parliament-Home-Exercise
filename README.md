## A cheeky attempt at recreating the feel of the UK Parliament website.

I tried to show a little bit of everything I know of (though I'm sure I've missed a few spots) so whilst it's not exactly the pinnacle of clean code a lot of love went into this.

At least it does what it asked for!

*I do hope it "runs on your machine" though...*
